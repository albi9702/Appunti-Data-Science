<div id="scenario" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Scenario</h1>
<p>Huge amount of data are exchanged on social media through various devices. Information process is fully integrated within object and activities.</p>
<p>Information is provided in real time on various social platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entities: books, records, etc.;</li>
<li>Events: launch of a new product, concert, etc.;</li>
<li>News: entertainment, politics, etc.;</li>
<li>Relationships: between entities, events, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>When collecting data, it is necessary to transform information, organized in classified data, in to knowledge, awareness and understanding in which info can be useful.</p>
<p><strong><em>S</em></strong>ocial <strong><em>M</em></strong>edia <strong><em>A</em></strong>nalytics (<strong>SMA</strong>) has a complex process of identifying relevant, valid, new and potentially useful information which can be transformed into knowledge used by different actors and purpose. The main applications of SMA are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Life quality, for transaction;</li>
<li>Brand reputation (awareness of the brand, sentiment, bad comments, consoling reputation, ect.);</li>
<li>Forecasting the performance of finance markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>The aim of the course is to provide the skills to start a Social Media specialist path to learn how to extract significant insights from the huge volume of mostly unstructured data using Social Media Analytics methods and tools.</p>

<div id="internet" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Internet</h2>
<p><em>Internet</em> is the global system to connect computers around the world. TCP/IP protocols allow devices connected through internet to communicate with each other. The <strong><em>W</em></strong>orld <strong><em>W</em></strong>ide <strong>W</strong>eb (<strong>WWW</strong>) is one of the major service of Internet. The proposal was designed to provide more effective communication system within <em>CERN</em>. It allows to browser through web pages and services accessible to all or a selected part of users.</p>
<p><strong><em>U</em></strong>niform <strong><em>R</em></strong>esource <strong><em>I</em></strong>dentifier (<strong>URI</strong>) is a sequence of characters that uniquely identifies a generic resource, such as web address (URL), documents, images, etc.</p>
<p>There are different type of data:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Structured</em>: data are stored in databases and organized in a rigid schemes and tables (Relational Scheme);</li>
<li><em>Semi-Structured</em>: data arenâ€™t stored in a tabular structure, but it contains tags to separate semantic elements (HTML, XML, JSON);</li>
<li><em>Unstructured</em>: data are stored without any scheme (Narrative Text).</li>
</ul>

<div id="social-media" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Social Media</h1>
<p>The social aspect of communication was to facilitate interaction between people who shared strong relationships, the same interests or find themselves working together in specific geographical contexts. The availability of information is made possible also by the presence and diffusion of Web Browser, Search Engines and <em>Social Media</em>.</p>
<p>There are three main distinction between data collected through the Web:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Virtual Data</em> (or Provoked Data), obtained through conventional research methods, such as queries online, and these answers are provided by users following specific questions;</li>
<li><em>Digitized Data</em>, analog data transformed in another digital formats (e.g.Â e-books, music, etc.);</li>
<li><em>Digital Data</em>, traces left by users, such as page visits or interactions with Social Media. In this case they are generated spontaneously by the users visiting a web page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Social Media has specific characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interactive web 2.0 applications;</li>
<li>Contents are generated by the users (posts, comments, etc.);</li>
<li>Users create service-specific profiles;</li>
<li>Social Media facilitates the development of online social networks.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most important theory about Social Media is the <em>Theory of Social Presence</em>. It states that media differ in degree of social presence between the influence of the degree of intimacy and immediacy of the means of communication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The higher the social presence, the larger the social influence that the communication partners have on each otherâ€™s behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Media Richness Theory</em> is based on the assumption that the goal of any communication is the resolution of ambiguity and the reduction of uncertainty. The media differs in the degree of information richness they have. The concept of <em>Self Presentation</em> states that in any type of social interaction people have a desire to control the impressions of other people. This concept is related to self-disclosure</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Social Media are <strong>interactive computer-mediated</strong> technologies that facilitate the <strong>creation and sharing of information</strong>, ideas, career interests and other forms of expression via <strong>virtual communities</strong> and networks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <strong><em>U</em></strong>ser-<strong><em>G</em></strong>enerated <strong><em>C</em></strong>ontent (<strong>UGC</strong>) is any form of content created by users of online system made available on social media. The reason for creating UGC are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Implicit Incentives</em>, not based on anything tangible, not directly monetizable. Social Incentives are the most common form; a user feels as active user of the community, also through the interaction of friends. It also improve the customer experience when purchasing a product;</li>
<li><em>Explicit Incentives</em>, referred to tangible rewards. They are easily understood by most people and have immediate value regardless of the size of the community (contest, voucher, etc.). The main disadvantage is they can make user believe that the only reason of participating is explicit incentive, reducing the influence of other type of interactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <em>Virtual Community</em> is made up of Social Network of individuals who interact through means of communication, crossing any kind of boundaries in order to pursue mutual interests.</p>
<p>A <em>Social Network</em> is a social structure made up of a set of individuals, a series of dyadic links and other social interactions of social actors. There are many methods to analyze the structure of social entities, called <strong><em>S</em></strong>ocial <strong><em>N</em></strong>etwork <strong><em>A</em></strong>nalysis (<strong>SNA</strong>), to identify local and global patterns and examine network dynamics.</p>
<!-- The evolution of Social Media -->
<p>There are many type of Social Media:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Blog</em>, a website containing one or more chronological posts that interactively discuss a certain topic;</li>
<li><em>Microblog</em>, publicational textual or multimedial content on the net;</li>
<li><em>News Sites</em>, the paper edition of the main newspaper. In these sites is possible to interact with other people;</li>
<li><em>Forums</em>, discussion sections in an IT platform or single sections;</li>
<li><em>Social Networking Sites</em>;</li>
<li><em>Virtual Game Worlds</em>;</li>
<li><em>Virtual Social Worlds</em>;</li>
<li><em>Content Communities</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These sites produce different type of data:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Articles</em>, mainly form news sites;</li>
<li><em>Posts</em>, generally blog and Social Networking Sites;</li>
<li><em>Tweets</em>, Twitterâ€™s content</li>
<li><em>Threads</em>, a conversation developed between multiple users;</li>
<li><em>Reviews</em>, ratings left by users;</li>
<li><em>Images</em> and <em>Videos</em>.</li>
</ul>

<div id="social-media-analytics" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Social Media Analytics</h2>
<p><em>Web Analytics</em> is the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of Web data for the purposes of understanding and optimizing Web usage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Social Media Analytics</em> is monitoring, analyzing, measuring and interpreting digital interactions and relationships of people, topics, ideas and content. Interaction takes place in workplace and external-facing communities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is possible to divide the analyzes into two main categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social Network Analysis;</li>
<li>Social Content Analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>SMA in the <em>business</em> context is the process of measuring, analyzing and interpreting interactions and conversations in Social Media regarding a brand, product, service or a topic of interest. The analysis is based on elements that influences the customer behavior, the perception and feelings of the customer respect to a brand end their level of engagement.</p>
<p>There are many business objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Brand Advocacy</em>, an indicator that expresses the highest degree of brand loyalty, so a customer can recommend the brand to other people;</li>
<li><em>Business Reputation Management</em>, constantly monitoring and managing the companyâ€™s online presence and how the brand is perceived in a positive light and allowing to gain new customers;</li>
<li><em>Community Management</em>, the process of building an authentic community through various interactions;</li>
<li><em>Demand Generation</em>, the strategy of various marketing programs aimed at certain interest in the products/services of a company.</li>
</ul>
<!-- Sistemare questa parte -->
<p>To plan an analysis activity is necessary to answer at these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Why</em>: the reasons that should lead to online analysis;</li>
<li><em>What</em>: what does the analytic activity consist of and what are the phases that make it up;</li>
<li><em>How</em>: what are the tools and resources to equip to create a structured and effective monitoring process;</li>
<li><em>Who</em>: who are the actors involved in the monitoring and analysis process of the web and Social Media;</li>
<li><em>Where</em>: what are the sources tha must be taken into consideration for an effective analysis;</li>
<li><em>When</em>: when and with what timing it is necessary to activate the listening and analysis strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>The phases of Social Media Analysis are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Planning of the analysis activity;</li>
<li>Data identification;</li>
<li>Data Analysis, models and techniques that allows to answer to the objectives developed, selected or integrated among those available;</li>
<li>Information interpretation and visualization, better interpreting information obtained from data analysis.</li>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Network and Graph Theory</h1>
<p><em>Network Theory</em> is the study of structures representing symmetrical or asymmetrical relationships between objects. It is also a part of Graph Theory: a graph is composed by nodes (also known as vertices) connected through link (edges).</p>
<p>Other examples of networks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technological networks, designed for distribution of goods, resources and services (e.g.Â Internet);</li>
<li>Information networks, made up of data and information linked together in some way (e.g.Â <strong><em>W</em></strong>orld <strong><em>W</em></strong>ide <strong><em>W</em></strong>eb);</li>
<li>Biological networks, representing the interaction patterns between biological elements (e.g.Â Neural Network);</li>
<li>Social networks, where vertices represent people of groups connected by some form of social interaction, such as friendship.</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, <strong><em>S</em></strong>ocial <strong><em>N</em></strong>etwork <strong><em>A</em></strong>nalysis (<strong>SNA</strong>) is the process of investigating social structures through the use of networks and <em>Graph Theory</em>. These networks are usually visualized in sociograms (also known as social network graph) where vertices are represented as points and edges as lines.</p>
<p>A <em>Graph</em> is a pair of vertices (<span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>) and edges (<span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>), <span class="math inline">\(G = (V, E)\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\(E \subseteq [V]^2\)</span>. The set of <em>vertices</em> of a graph is denoted as <span class="math inline">\(V(G) = {v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n}\)</span>, while the set of <em>Edges</em> is denoted as <span class="math inline">\(E(G) = {e_1, e_2, \dots, e_n}\)</span>. The representation is drawing a point for each vertex and join these points with lines if thereâ€™s a connection:</p>

<div id="undirected-graph" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Undirected Graph</h2>
<p>An <em>Undirected</em> graph is a graph with all bidirectional edges (e.g.Â Facebook). Given the edge <span class="math inline">\(e = (a,b)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> is called <em>Outgoing</em> edge from <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, denoted as direct <em>Predecessor</em>, and <em>Ingoing</em> edge in <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, known as direct <em>Successor</em>. Given a vertex <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> of a directed graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(E^+(a)\)</span> is the set of outgoing edges from <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E^-(a)\)</span> the set of incoming edges in <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. A <em>Sink</em> vertex is a vertex with only incoming edges, while with only outgoing edges is called <em>Source</em> vertex.</p>
<!-- Undirected Graph Image -->
<p><img src="Immagini/Undirected-Graph.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The <em>Degree</em> of a vertex, <span class="math inline">\(d(v)\)</span> is the number of edge incident to a node, equivalent to the number of neighbors of <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>; each loop is counted twice, while a vertex with degree 0 is an isolated vertex. The value <span class="math inline">\(\delta(G) = \min \{d(v) \text{ } | \text{ } v \in V \}\)</span> is the minimum degree, while the value <span class="math inline">\(\Delta(G) = \max \{d(v) \text{ } | \text{ } v \in V \}\)</span> is the maximum degree:</p>
<!-- Degree of a Graph Image -->
<p><img src="Immagini/Degree.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>There are many different type of graphs:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Null</em> graph, made up of only isolated graphs;</li>
<li><em>Regular</em> graph, if all vertices of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> have the same degree <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>;</li>
<li><em>Complete</em> graph, in which each pair of distinct vertices are adjacent;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="directed-graph" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Directed Graph</h2>
<p>A graph is <em>Directed</em> if edges are directed from one vertex to another (e.g.Â Twitter). Given the edge <span class="math inline">\(e = (a, b)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are called <em>Extreme</em> and <em>Adjacent</em> vertices of <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>, called the <em>incident</em> edge. <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is called <em>Neighbor</em> of <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and vice versa. Two edges <span class="math inline">\(e, f\)</span> are <em>Adjacent</em> if they have a common vertex. The <em>Neighborhood</em> of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(N(a)\)</span>, is the set of vertices adjacent to <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. The <em>Star</em> of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(s(a)\)</span>, is the set of edges incident in <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>.</p>
<!-- Directed Graph Image -->
<p><img src="Immagini/Directed-Graph.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The <em>In-Degree</em> of a vertex <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is the number of edges arriving at the <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> vertex, while the <em>Out-Degree</em> is the number of edges starting from the vertex <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>.</p>
<!-- Out and In-Degree of a Graph Image -->
<p><img src="Immagini/Out-In-Degree.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The <em>Degree</em> <span class="math inline">\(d(v)\)</span> of a vertex <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is the sum of the number of its incoming and outgoing edges.</p>
</div>
<div id="subgraph" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Subgraph</h2>
<p>A <em>Subgraph</em> of a graph <span class="math inline">\(G = (V, E)\)</span> is a graph included with in the main graph that contains all vertices and edges in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. It is possible to obtain subgraphs by removing some vertices and/or edges from <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>
<p>Given a graph <span class="math inline">\(G = (V, E)\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(V = \{v_1, \dots, v_n \}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E = \{e_1, \dots, e_n \}\)</span>, a <em>Walk</em> is a finite (or infinite) alternating sequence of vertices and edges. A walk is called <em>Simple</em> if edges and vertices of the walk are all distinct, otherwise it is <em>Not Simple</em>. In particular, there are many different types of walks:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Trail</em>, in which all edges are distinct;</li>
<li><em>Path</em>, in which all vertices are distinct;</li>
<li><em>Directed</em>, for each edge in the walk the initial vertex is the head and final is the tail of the walk;</li>
<li><em>Closed</em>, where the extreme vertices coincide (also known as cycle). A circuit allows repetition of vertices, but not edges.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="connected" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Connected</h2>
<p>Connectivity <span class="math inline">\(k(G)\)</span> is the basic concept of graph theory. It measures the minimum number of elements that must be removed to disconnect the graph. In particular, an <em>Articular</em> point is a vertex whose removal disconnects a component of the graph, while a <em>Bridge</em> is an edge whose removal disconnect a component of the graph.</p>
<!-- Bridge and Articular Point of a Graph Image -->
<p><img src="Immagini/Bridge-Articular-Point.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>When <span class="math inline">\(k(G) = 2\)</span>, we talk about <em>Biconnectivity</em> no single edge or vertex removal disconnects the graph and no network failure points compromise the network itself.</p>
<!-- Lecture 5: 14/10/2020 -->
</div>
<div id="clustering" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Clustering</h2>
<p>A <em>Clique</em> is a set of vertices <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> totally connected in a graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. It usually ignores single vertices and vertex connected by an edge. In particular, a <em>Maximal Clique</em> is a clique not extended adding a new adjacent vertex, while a <em>Maximum Clique</em> is the largest clique in a graph.</p>
<!-- Clique Image -->
<p><img src="Immagini/Clique.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The <em>Clustering Coefficient</em> is the measure of the degree in which nodes tend to be connected to each other. There are 3 different ways to calculate this:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Local Clustering Coefficient</em>: given a set of neighbors <span class="math inline">\(N(v)\)</span>, it is the number of edges between the members of neighbors divided by the number of potential edges between them (<span class="math inline">\(k = d(v)\)</span>):</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[cc(v) = \frac{||N(v)||}{k(k-1)} \qquad

<!-- Local Clustering Coefficient Image -->
<p><img src="Immagini/LCC.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Average Clustering Coefficient</em>, which is the average of the clustering coefficient for each single node of the graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>:</li>
</ul>

<p>In <em>Random Networks</em> pairs of nodes are randomly connected by a given number of connections. Two nodes are connected by a certain probability. All nodes have approximately the same number of neighbors, which differs slightly from the average value.</p>
<!-- Random Networks Image -->
<p><img src="Immagini/Random-Network.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><em>Complex Networks</em> of interactions have substantially different characteristics from both classes. The Complex Network Theory shows non intuitive characteristics and can be made up of millions of units communicating with each other. Mathematical methods are used to extract information from complex networks in a synthetic way. For example,online social networks are complex networks: the personal network of contact is usually composed of a first order area, with an ego-centric network, with direct relationship, a second order and so on, with a socio-centric network.</p>
<!-- Ego Socio Networks Image -->
<p><img src="Immagini/Ego-Socio-Networks.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>There are several phenomena related to the Theory of Complex Networks:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Small Word</em>, an experiment remained famous and repeated in various social networks. Milligram randomly chose a sample fo American and asked them to deliver a message to a stranger knowing only few information. The results show how short paths exist between individuals in large social networks and how can be found by ordinary people;</li>
<li><em>Clustering</em>, a tendency in social network where are created communities in relation with each other, measured by clustering coefficient (<span class="math inline">\(cc\)</span>). Random networks resemble interaction networks with reference to the small world property, but they differ in the clustering coefficient because in a typical interaction network <span class="math inline">\(cc\)</span> is usually much larger than a <span class="math inline">\(cc\)</span> of a random network;</li>
<li><em>Strength of Weak Ties</em>, a strength of a tie is given by the probably linear combination of the amount of time, emotional intensity, intimacy and exchange of services characterizing the tie. <em>Strong Ties</em> are people united in primary networks (eg family, organization), while <em>Weak Ties</em> those who characterize the informal networks of people, more important than the strong one. The <em>Tie Strength</em> is measured by identifying <em>Shortcut Bridges</em>, loosing the bridge and check if the distance between two nodes increases when the arc is removed;</li>
<li><em>Scale Invariance</em>, a negative exponential relationship between the number of nodes and the number of their connection. When a node need to establish a new connection, it prefers to do it with a node (tipically called <em>Hubs</em>) with many connections, leading to exponential growth. The role of hubs is connecting areas of the graph that would otherwise be separate.</li>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Metrics for Social Media Analytics</h1>
<p>There are three main families of metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Connection</em>, in which social network entities are connected;</li>
<li><em>Distribution</em>, in which information can flow within a social network;</li>
<li><em>Segmentation</em>, clustering the components of the social network.</li>
</ul>
<div id="connection-metrics" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Connection Metrics</h2>
<!-- Metrics:
    
     * Homophily;
     * Multiplexity;
     * Mutuality/Reciprocity;
     * Network Closure;
     * Proximity/Propinquity. -->
<p><em>Homophily</em> is the tendency of individuals to associate and tie with each other similar one, sharing common characteristics (e.g.Â gender or age) that facilitate communication and relationship formation. Social Media favors homophilic relationships because it shows similar posts of your interest by your user profile examined with likes and interactions personalizing your content. The perception of interpersonal similarity improves coordination and the expected payoff of interaction and helps people access information forming opinions and threads, but can translate in a limited social worlds forming closed communities or filter bubbles on Social Network sites where people with similar ideologies interact only with each other (Echo Chambers).</p>
<p><em>Multiplexity</em> is the number of relationship levels contained in a link, associated with the strength of the bond.</p>
<p><em>Mutuality/Reciprocity</em> is the extent to which two actors mutually exchange friendship or other interaction.</p>
<p><em>Network Closure</em> measures the completeness of relational triads, using various clustering coefficient <span class="math inline">\(cc\)</span> to measure this closure. It refers to the concept of triadic closure, a property in which 3 nodes <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> have strong tie <span class="math inline">\(A-B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A-C\)</span>, then there is a strong or weak tie <span class="math inline">\(B-C\)</span>. Another theory based on Network Closure is the Cognitive Balance, the propensity of two individuals to want to try the same things toward an entities that unites them. If the triad is not closed, then the people connected want to close thi triad to achieve closure in the relationship. In a social network a strong triadic closure occurs with a high probability because they have many things in common and they can create a link. It can predict the development of ties in a network and show the progression of connectivity.</p>
<p><em>Proximity/Propinquity</em> is the tendency for actors to have more links with others who are geographically close, measured with geolocation information. For example, two people living on the same floor have a higher propensity to establish relationships than those living on different floors.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Distribution Metrics</h2>
<!-- Metrics:
    
     * Bridges;
     * Centrality;
     * Density;
     * Distance;
     * Structural Holes;
     * Strength of a Tie. -->
<p><em>Centrality</em> is a group of metrics that aim to quantify the importance or influence of a particular node in a network. In Graph Theory it identifies the most important vertices, in a Social Network the most influential people. The general case is called <em>Degree Centrality</em>, the risk of a node to catch whatever is flowing through the network (in the graph theory is the degree of a vertex): <span class="math inline">\(c_D(v) = d(v)\)</span>. In a directed graph is necessary to explicit the in-degree and out-degree. It is possible to normalize the degree centrality, computed as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\overline{c_D} = \frac{c_D(v)}{n - 1}\]</span></p>
<p>In a connected graph the <em>Closeness Centrality</em> <span class="math inline">\(c_C(v)\)</span> is the reciprocal of the sum of the distances from <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> to all other nodes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[c_C(v) = \frac{1}{\sum_u d(v, u)}\]</span></p>
<p>The Normalized version is expressed as <span class="math inline">\(\overline{c_C}(v) = (n-1) c_C(v)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The <em>Betweennes Centrality</em> <span class="math inline">\(c_B(v)\)</span> is the sum of the number of the shortest path between each pair that cross the vertex (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{st}(v)\)</span>) divided by the number of shortest paths between each pair of vertices in a graph (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{st}\)</span>):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[c_B(v) = \sum_{s \ne t \ne v} \frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}}\]</span></p>
<p>It is possible to compute the Normalized Betweennes Centrality as the <span class="math inline">\(c_B(v)\)</span> divided by the maximum possible number of geodesics crossing node <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(2c_B(v)\)</span> for undirected graphs):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\overline{c_B}(v) = \frac{c_B(v)}{(n - 1)(n - 2)}\]</span></p>
<p><em>Delta Centrality</em> is the importance of a node in the entire network, calculated by comparing the performance <span class="math inline">\(P(G)\)</span> (as the number of edges) to the performance <span class="math inline">\(P(G&#39;)\)</span> obtained deactivating the node <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[C_{\Delta} = \frac{P(G) - P(G&#39;)}{P(G)}\]</span></p>
<p>It is possible to calculate the Delta Centrality using Efficiency, measured as the inverse of their distance <span class="math inline">\(d(v_i, v_j)\)</span>. The efficiency of a graph is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E(G) = \frac{1}{n(n - 1)} \sum^n_{i, j = 1} \frac{1}{d(v_i, v_j)}\]</span></p>
<p><em>Density</em> is the percentage of effective links in a network out of the total possible number. A dense graph is a graph in which the number of effective edges approaches the number of potential edges, while a sparse graph the number with few edges than the potential ones. The degree is measured as follow (<span class="math inline">\(2|E(G)|\)</span> if undirected graph):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[D(G) \frac{|E(G)|}{n(n - 1)}\]</span></p>
<p>Other Distribution Metrics are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Distance</em> is the minimum number of ties necessary to connect two people;</li>
<li><em>Structural Holes</em> is the absence of links between two parts of a network;</li>
<li><em>Strength of a Tie</em> is the linear combination of time, emotional intensity, intimacy, reciprocity, ect.</li>

<p>There are two different type of Counting:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Counting of Cliques</em>, if each individual is directly related to each other individual;</li>
<li><em>Counting of Social Circles</em>, groups of individuals less closely linked than in a clique.</li>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Community Detection</h1>
<p>Preferential Attachment is a property of some network where the great majority of new edges are connected to nodes with an already high degree, compared to others. The result is a network with very few nodes with an high degree of connection.</p>
<!-- Preferential Attachment Image-->
<p><img src="Immagini/Preferential-Attachment.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
It can happen because people want to be associated with popular people, ideas, etc, increasing their <em>popularity</em>; <em>quality</em>, evaluating people based on objective quality criteria, so higher nodes will attract more attention; <em>mixed model</em>, among nodes of similar attribute.</p>
<p>A <em>Community</em> is a subset of nodes among which there are relatively strong, direct and frequente ties (e.g.Â group, cluster). One of the most important task studying network is identifying communities, which allows to discover groups of interacting people, studying interaction between them, inferring missing node values or predicting unobserved connections. In Social Network communities represent groups of nodes (users) that show similar characteristic and interaction among them (link prediction). The definition can be subjective, because it can be densely-knit or each component can be a community. Communities can be overlap, in which some users belong to 2 communities, or disjoint, in which each node belongs exclusively to 1 community.</p>
<!-- Overlapping Disjoint Communities Image-->
<p><img src="Immagini/Overlapping-Disjoint-Communities.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The Link Prediction is the prediction of which nodes are likely get connected given a Social Network; the output is a list of ranked pairs of nodes.</p>
<p>The Community Detection is confused for clustering, but in the first data is linked in a graph and network data tends to be discrete, leading algorithm using the graph property directly.</p>
<!-- Different Categories of Community Detection -->
<p>Community Detection methods can be divided into 4 main categories:</p>
<!-- Categories:

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Node-centric Community</h2>
<p>The <em>Node-centric Community</em> is a community in which each node in a group satisfies certain properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Complete Mutuality</em>, where nodes belong to just one clique. A clique is a maximal complete subgraph of 3 or more nodes all adjacent to each other. It is possible to find communities for the maximum cliques or all maximal cliques.

<li><em>Nodal Degrees</em> (<!-- non pervenuto-->).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="group-centric-community" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Group-centric Community</h2>
<p>The <em>Group-centric Community</em> is a community which requires the whole group to satisfy a certain condition. The main concept is the network density, defined as the number of edges in the network over the total number of possible edges between all pairs of nodes. It measures how well connected a network is (perfectly connected network is a clique). A subgraph is a quasi-clique if</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{2 |E_s|}{|V_s| (|V_s| - 1)} \geq \gamma\]</span></p>
<p>A greedy algorithm can be adopted to find a maximal quasi-clique, starting from the node with the largest degree and expanding it with nodes likely contribute to a larger quasi-clique. This method continues until no mode node can be added.</p>
<!-- Lecture 11: 11/11/2020 -->
</div>
<div id="network-centric-community" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Network-centric Community</h2>
<p><em>Network-centric Community</em> aims to find communities considering global connection of nodes and divide network into disjoint set. The main approaches are:</p>
<!-- Approaches: 

      * Node Similarity
      * Latent Space Model (Spectrum)
      * Modularity Maximization -->
<p><em>Node Similarity</em> measures how similar their interaction patterns are. Two nodes are structurally equivalent if they connect to the same set of nodes (they share the same set of neighbors). This definition is too strict because rarely occur in a large scale and is difficult to compute. To resolve this it is possible to use vector similarity, creating a matrix of connections and calculate the Cosine Similarity or Jaccard Similarity:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    cos(\theta) &amp;= \frac{A B}{\|A\| \|B\|}
    J(A, B)     &amp;= \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|}
  \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>It is useful for huge network for computing the vertex similarity and applying <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-means clustering algorithm: each cluster is associated with a centroid and each node is assigned to the cluster with the closest centroid (recompute the centroid of each cluster).</p>
<p>Another possible approach is the <em>Spectral Clustering</em>, representing a similarity graph as a matrix and analyse the spectrum (= eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>) of the matrix:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{bmatrix}
    w_{11} &amp; \dots &amp; w_{1n} \\
    \vdots &amp; \dots &amp; \vdots \\
    w_{n1} &amp; \dots &amp; w_{nn} \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \times
  \begin{bmatrix}
    w_{11} \\
    \vdots \\
    w_{n1} \\
  \end{bmatrix} =
  \lambda
  \begin{bmatrix}
    x_{1} \\
    \vdots \\
    x_{n} \\
  \end{bmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p>The goal is embed points in a low-dimensional space, in which cluster denoting communities are more easy to find. It is necessary to compute the Adjacency matrix and compute the Laplacian matrix:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[A_{ij} = 
    \begin{cases}
      w_{ij} \text{ weight of edge } (i, j) \\
      0      \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}\]</span></p>
<p>So the basic stages of spectral clustering are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Pre-processing: Construct a matrix representation of the dataset;</li>
<li>Decomposition: compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix and map each point to a lower dimension based on 1 or more eigenvectors.</li>
<li>Grouping: assign points to 2 or more clusters based non the new representation.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Modularity Maximization</em> tries to maximize the distance of a network from a random network. Modularity measures the group interaction compared with the expected random connection. In a network with <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> edges, for two nodes <span class="math inline">\(d_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d_j\)</span> the expected random connection between them is
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{d_i d_j}{2E}\)</span>. The modularity of a group is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sum(A_{ij} - \frac{d_i d_j}{2E})\]</span></p>
<p>and is necessary to maximize:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{2E} \sum_C \sum_{i,j \in C} (A_{ij} - \frac{d_i d_j}{2E})z_{ij}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(z_{ij}\)</span> defines if two edges are in the same group (0 otherwise). If <span class="math inline">\(A_ij\)</span> is very close to the expected random network, the relationship between two nodes is weak (<span class="math inline">\(A_ij\)</span> matrix considered as random). Finally it is possible to compute the spectral clustering and using <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-means approach to select the communities.</p>

<p><em>Hierarchy-centric Community</em> aims to build a hierarchical structure of communities based on network topology. It facilitates the analysis of different resolutions. There are two approaches:</p>
<!-- Approaches: 

      * Divisive Hierarchical Clustering
      * Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering -->
<p>The <em>Divisive Hierarchical Clustering</em> divides the nodes into several set, where each set is further partitioned into a smaller set. To determine these partition it is possible to use Network-centric Methods. One particular example is based on edge-betweenness, called Girvan-Newman Algorithm (repeat until all edges are removed):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Compute the edge-betweenness for all edges in the graph;</li>
<li>Remove the edge with the highest betweenness;</li>
<li>Re-compute betweenness for all edges affected by the edge removal;</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering</em> initializes each node as a community. It chooses two communities satisfying certain criteria and merges into larger one. It is possible to use Maximum Node Similarity or Maximum Modularity Increase.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Evaluation</h2>
<p>The perfect communities would be objects of the same type in the same community, but this is simply impossible. There are two types of evaluation:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>With Ground Truth</em>, partial knowledge of what communities look like and it is given the correct community assignments. Measures are:
<ul>
<li>Precision;</li>
<li>Recall;</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Without Ground Truth</em>, in a matter of analyzing attributes, such as posts, profile information, of community members to see if there is a coherency among them. It is possibile to use word frequency and wordclouds to find the top topics discussed by communities. Measures are:
<ul>
<li>SSE;</li>
<li>Community Detection algorithms.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Communities also expand, shirk or dissolve in dynamic networks:</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Assortativity and Dynamics</h1>
<p>In some cases hubs connect to hubs and sometimes they avoid each other, it depends on the structural properties. This pattern is a general property of real networks: it is a phenomenon known as <em>Degree Correlation</em> <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>, defined as the probability to find a node with degree <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> at the two ends of a randomly selected link (<span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is the number of edges between two elements).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[e = \frac{E}{\|E\|}\]</span></p>
<p>The probability <span class="math inline">\(q_k\)</span> that there is a degree-<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> node at the end of the randomly selected link is the following (<span class="math inline">\(p_k\)</span> is the degree probability):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[q_k = \frac{k p_k}{\overline k}\]</span></p>
<p>Hubs are expected to link to each other on how many links they have. They can be:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Assortative</em>, hubs show a tendency to link to each other. <span class="math inline">\(e_{ij}\)</span> is high along the main diagonal so nodes of comparable degree tend to link to each other;</li>
<li><em>Neutral</em>, nodes connected to each other with the expected random probabilities. The density of links is symmetric around the average degree, so nodes link to each other randomly;</li>
<li>Disarsortative, hubs tend to avoid linking to each other. <span class="math inline">\(e_{ij}\)</span> is high along the secondary diagonal, so hubs tend to connect to small degree nodes.</li>
</ul>
<!-- Hubs Hubs Image-->
<p><img src="Immagini/Hubs-Hubs.jpg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>If the networks has no degree correlations, <span class="math inline">\(e_{jk} = q_j q_k\)</span>, otherwise the magnitude of the correlation is captured by <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{j, k} jk (e_{jk} - q_j q_k)\)</span>. This is expected to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(&gt; 0\)</span> for assortative networks;</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(= 0\)</span> for neutral networks;</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(&lt; 0\)</span> for dissasortative networks.</li>
</ul>
<p>To compare different network, it is possible to normalize the degree correlation coefficient:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[r = \frac{\sum_{j, k} jk (e_{jk} - q_j q_k)}{\sum_k [k^2 - q_k - (\sum_k k q_k)^2]} \in [-1, +1]\]</span></p>
<!-- Degree Correlation Image-->
<p><img src="Immagini/Degree-Correlation.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>An important property of a random network is the emergence of a phase transition at <span class="math inline">\(&lt;k&gt; = 1\)</span>, marking the appearance of the <em>Giant Component</em>. For Assortative networks, the transition happens to a lower value of <span class="math inline">\(&lt;k&gt;\)</span>, hence a giant component emerges for <span class="math inline">\(&lt;k&gt; &lt; 1\)</span> because it easer to start it if the high-degree nodes seek out <!-- cercarsi --> each other. Otherwise, for Disassortative networks the transition is delayed since the hubs tend to connect to small degree nodes and have difficulty to form the giant component.</p>
<!-- Finish Resilience -->
<p>Alteration of the giant component have implications for network robustness. The <em>Network Resilience</em> is the effects of node and edge removal. In Assortative networks hub removal makes less damage because the hubs form a core group, while in disassortative networks is more damaging because hubs are connected to many small degree nodes. It is related to <em>Percolation</em> <!-- filtration -->, when a giant component is formed.</p>

<div id="sentiment-analysis" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Sentiment Analysis</h1>
<p>From Social Network is possible to extract information about a given argument and analyzed them to make decisions (e.g.Â predicting market data, better quality of life). This is not so simple because it is necessary to transform data from unstructured (cannot be displayed in rows, requires more storage and are more difficult to manage) to structured data, displayed in rows-columns and requires less storage.</p>
<!-- Structured VsUnstructured Image-->
<p><img src="Immagini/Structured-Vs-Unstructured.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The transformation is necessary to extract some important information like emotion, polarity, topic and the language of the user.</p>
<p>In order to extract some useful information, it is necessary to set some basic components for SMA:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the <em>Opinion Holder</em> (User) that holds a specific opinion;</li>
<li>Identify the <em>Object</em> on which an opinion is expressed;</li>
<li>Identify the Aspect of the object;</li>
<li>Identify the <em>Opinion</em> on an object from a user.</li>
</ul>
<p>Social Media Analytics should be able to interpret natural language to discover if an information is subjective and determine the corresponding polarity. A text is <em>objective</em> if a post presents factual information about the world, while <em>subjective</em> if expresses feeling, emotions or beliefs. An <em>explicit</em> opinion is a subjective statement giving an opinion, while <em>implicit</em> implies an opinion. An <em>ironic</em> post is a communicative way expressing the opposite what is literally said. Emotions are complex reaction pattern involving experiential and physiological elements in which a person attempt to deal with.</p>
<p>The process of SMA is constituted by:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Collect</em> real time expressions or opinion on-line or off-line;</li>
<li><em>Represent</em> text from qualitative to quantitative data to measure compare and learn. The pre-processing techniques are remove stopwords, numbers and punctuation and apply the stemmatization. Furthermore, it is possible to represent in a vector space model the text. It is possible also to use the Word2vec model; <!-- Recall to Text Mining -->.</li>
<li><em>Classify</em> measuring, compare and learn sentiments. It is possible to classify in different ways:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Lexicon-based Approach, for each sentence the process identifies term belonging to the list containing positive and negative terms with different weights. This lists is contained in a lexicon and one of the most important is the Liu lexicon opinion. The polarity of a text is given by the number of the positive and negative terms. For example, if <span class="math inline">\(\text{Word}_{\text{positive}} &gt; \text{Word}_{\text{negative}}\)</span> the word is positive;</li>
<li>Supervised Learning, an approach in which some text are labeled and it is possible to learn a model in order to predict new texts with the corresponding polarity. To deal with negation is possible to add <em>NOT_</em> to every word between negation.</li>
<li>Semi-Supervised Learning uses a small amount of information (e.g.Â few labeled examples and hand-built patterns) to enrich the lexicon predefined. It is possible to label a seed set of words and expand it to conjoined adjectives and cluster into two partition (positive and negative). Another possible approach is extract a phrasal lexicon from reviews using Part of Speech Tagging, identify and quantify the polarity and rate a reviews by the average polarity of phrases using Mutual and Point-wise Mutual Information <!-- Recall to Text Mining -->;</li>
<li>Unsupervised Learning, suitable for aspect-based sentiment analysis.</li>
